## About Me
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joel Mendonsa, a passionate student diving deep into the exciting world of data science. Currently pursuing my studies in data science, I've recently completed a course in artificial intelligence, delving into the realms of machine learning algorithms and techniques. This semester, I'm thrilled to explore the mathematical foundations behind machine learning, all while sharpening my skills in the R programming language.

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository on Machine Learning with R! As part of my journey in data science education, I've embarked on this project to consolidate my learnings and share valuable resources with fellow learners like you. Whether you're a beginner stepping into the realm of machine learning or an enthusiast seeking to deepen your understanding, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to leveraging R for your machine learning endeavors.

# Easy Machine Learning with R

## Description
Welcome to my Machine Learning with R repository! I'm Joel Mendonsa, and here you'll find simple guides and examples to learn machine learning using R.
You'll explore basic machine learning techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), K-means clustering, natural language processing (NLP), and neural networks.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

For this project, I primarily use RStudio as my preferred IDE for R programming. Here are some of the reasons why I find RStudio to be an excellent choice:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: RStudio provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced R users to navigate and work with.

- **Built-In Tools**: It comes with a variety of built-in tools for code editing, debugging, package management, version control, and more, streamlining the development workflow.

- **Interactive Environment**: RStudio offers an interactive environment with features like code execution, variable exploration, and visualization integration, enhancing productivity and collaboration.

- **R Markdown Support**: RStudio has excellent support for R Markdown, allowing seamless integration of code, output, and narrative text for reproducible research and dynamic reporting.

While RStudio is my primary choice, I've also experimented with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for R development. VS Code is another powerful IDE with a wide range of features and extensions. However, personally, I find RStudio to be better suited for R programming due to its specialized features and seamless integration with R.

Before installing RStudio, ensure you have R installed on your desktop. If you haven't installed R yet, you can download it here this link will take you to the official website of R [R Program](https://cran.r-project.org/). Once you have R installed, click on this link to download and install RStudio Desktop [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).


## Useful Libraries in R for Machine Learning
When it comes to machine learning in R, several libraries stand out for their ease of use and powerful functionality. Some of the most popular ones include:

- **caret**: A versatile package for classification and regression training.
- **randomForest**: Implements random forest algorithms for classification and regression.
- **e1071**: Provides functions for support vector machines, clustering, and more.
- **nnet**: Used for training and testing neural networks.
- **tm**: A text mining package often used for natural language processing tasks.
- **cluster**: Offers various clustering algorithms.
- **glmnet**: Implements Lasso and Elastic-Net regularized generalized linear models.
- **ggplot2**: A powerful package for data visualization, allowing you to create elegant and informative plots.

These libraries, among others, provide a wide range of tools to tackle different machine learning tasks in R, making them essential resources for any data scientist, and remember there is a vast library in R and I would suggest you to look into it and make use of each library you need.

## How to Install Packages in R 
Installing packages in R is straightforward and can be done using the `install.packages()` function. Here's a simple guide:

1. **Open R Console**: Launch R and open the R console.

2. **Install Package**: To install a package, use the following syntax:
   ```R
   install.packages("package_name")

3. **Example**: For instance, to install the caret package, you can use the following command:

   ```R
   install.packages("caret")
   ```
# Linear Regression Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Linear Regression project folder! In this repository, you'll find practice and project files related to linear regression analysis. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.

### What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Simple linear regression, a specific form of linear regression, involves a single independent variable used to predict the value of a dependent variable. It models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data points. The equation takes the form:

\[ y = mx + c \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).
- \( x \) is the independent variable (the variable we use to make predictions).
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (representing the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \)).
- \( c \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x \) is 0).

Simple linear regression aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points, minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

# Logistic Regression Project

### What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for classification tasks, particularly when the outcome variable is binary (i.e., has only two possible outcomes). Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that an observation belongs to a particular category.

#### Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)
The logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, is used in logistic regression to model the probability of the positive class. It has the following form:

\[ p(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]

Where:
- \( p(x) \) is the predicted probability of the positive class.
- \( z \) is the linear combination of the predictor variables and their coefficients.

#### Odds Ratio
In logistic regression, the odds ratio is used to quantify the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of the positive outcome. It is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:

\[ Odds Ratio = \frac{P(Y=1)}{1 - P(Y=1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_nX_n} \]

Where:
- \( P(Y=1) \) is the probability of the positive outcome.
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients of the logistic regression model.
- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) are the predictor variables.

# KNN

### 1. What is KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)?

KNN, or K-Nearest Neighbors, is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is based on the principle of similarity, where an object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.
